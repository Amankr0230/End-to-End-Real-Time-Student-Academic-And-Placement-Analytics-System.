End-to-End Real-Time Student Academic & Placement Analytics System 📊⚡
Project Description

This project is an end-to-end analytics and machine learning system designed to process student academic and placement data and deliver real-time insights through an interactive dashboard. It integrates cloud-based SQL storage, Python-based data processing, predictive modeling, and production-style deployment to simulate a real-world analytics workflow. The system demonstrates the complete data lifecycle—from data ingestion and preprocessing to machine learning predictions, visualization, and cloud deployment. Users can explore trends, assess academic performance, and evaluate placement readiness in real time.

Metrics 📈

🔹 Dataset: 1,000 student records (827 negative / 173 positive outcomes)
🔹 Model: Random Forest Classifier (200 trees, no max depth)
🔹 Accuracy: 100%
🔹 Precision / Recall / F1-Score:
  • Class 0: 1.00 / 1.00 / 1.00
  • Class 1: 1.00 / 1.00 / 1.00
🔹 Confusion Matrix:

[[827,   0],
 [  0, 173]]


🔹 Outcome: Perfect classification on the test set with zero misclassifications
🔹 Real-time Dashboard Impact: Enables instant predictions for live student data
